1. All lights in the buildings are turned off
2. All doors in the buildings are closed

Oh yes, and the daughter of your boss lost her Goob-Plushies... collect them all. 
Then leave the facility through the gate on the fence. 
Oh yes and IT likes the light and the plushies... maybe IT will become angry. Don't get caught by IT.

Controls:
WASD - Walking
E - Interact
F - Flashlight"
